# Matchday Exchange — Football Simulation & Sportsbook

[![CI](https://github.com/Tobilion/matchday-exchange/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Tobilion/matchday-exchange/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

**Live demo: [matchday-exchange.vercel.app](https://matchday-exchange.vercel.app/)**

![Demo](demo.gif)

Matchday Exchange is an offline-first, 32-team knockout/league football simulation and betting game that runs entirely in the browser — no account, no API keys required to play. A real-time match engine drives live odds, and every bet you place settles against matches actually simulated tick by tick. An optional wallet/settlement server (live at the link below) makes your balance server-authoritative rather than client-editable; without it, everything still works exactly the same via local computation.

## Features

- **Real-time match simulation** — tick-by-tick engine simulating possession, shots, goals, fouls, cards, injuries and weather, weighted by team ratings, tactics and form
- **Full sportsbook** — 1X2, BTTS, over/under and player markets with live-shifting odds, single & accumulator slips, Bet Builder (combine markets from one match), and mid-match Cash Out with live valuation
- **Multi-club ownership** — buy multiple clubs simultaneously with your winnings; each club has its own squad, tactics, stadium, and training facility. A multi-club switcher appears in ClubManager and TransferMarket whenever you own more than one club
- **Injury-aware squad management** — 18-player squads (11 starters + 7 reserves). Injured and suspended players are automatically excluded from the starting XI, with fit bench players filling in automatically. The ClubManager visually marks unavailable players (INJ / SUSP) and prevents them from being selected as starters
- **Transfer Market** — multi-bid system: you can now bid on multiple players simultaneously. Each bid is reserved immediately from your wallet on placement, refunded automatically if outbid or withdrawn, and your active bids panel shows Leading / Outbid status in real time. Auctions settle at round advance
- **Career layer** — player development (fatigue, morale, form), promotion/relegation, Player of the Match awards, form guides and head-to-head stats before every fixture
- **Casino suite** — 14 mini-games (roulette, crash, blackjack and more) sharing one wallet with the sportsbook
- **Challenges & tipsters** — daily missions, win-streak challenges, and AI tipster leaderboards
- **Offline-first** — all state persists in localStorage; close the tab and pick up where you left off
- **Polished UI** — glassmorphism panels, glow orbs, spotlight cards, smooth micro-animations, custom toast system and empty-state components

## Getting started

Prerequisite: Node.js 18+ ([nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)). Then, in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tobilion/matchday-exchange.git
cd football-tournament-betting-simulator
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:3001**. The dev server hot-reloads as you edit.

### Optional: wallet/settlement server

By default the game still runs 100% client-side, exactly as before. There's
now an optional local server that becomes the source of truth for your
wallet balance and bet settlement instead of the browser:

```bash
npm run server   # starts on http://localhost:4400, separate terminal
```

With it running, placing a bet and cashing out are validated and paid out
server-side (the same settlement math as always, just relocated somewhere a
browser devtools session can't edit it directly). Without it running, the
game works exactly as it did before — every call falls back to local
computation automatically. See `CLAUDE.md` for what this does and doesn't
close from a security standpoint.

Try it: open devtools, edit your balance directly in localStorage or React
state, then place a bet. With the server running, the balance gets corrected
back on the next server round-trip — it never reads what you tampered with.

### Deploying the wallet server (optional, for the live demo)

The live site works fully offline-first with no server, same as running it
locally. The wallet server for this project is deployed and live at
**https://matchday-exchange-server.onrender.com** — the deployed frontend's
`VITE_API_BASE_URL` already points at it, so bets placed on the live demo hit
the real server unless it's cold (see the trade-off note below).

To redeploy your own copy of the server so a fork's live demo shows the same
tamper-resistance:

1. Push this repo to GitHub (already done if you're reading this on GitHub).
2. On [Render](https://render.com), either:
   - **Blueprint (recommended):** choose **New → Blueprint**, point it at
     this repo — `render.yaml` at the project root pre-fills the build/start
     commands (`npm ci`, `npm run server:start`) on the free tier; or
   - **Manual Web Service:** choose **New → Web Service**, connect this repo,
     and when Render doesn't auto-detect `render.yaml`, set Build Command to
     `npm ci` and Start Command to `npm run server:start` yourself. Pick
     **Web Service**, not Private Service — a Private Service is only
     reachable from other Render services on the same private network, not
     from your public Vercel frontend.
3. After the first deploy, set `CU_BET_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in the Render
   dashboard to your actual frontend domain(s), comma-separated (it defaults
   to `localhost` only — the deployed server will reject the deployed
   frontend's requests until this is set).
4. In Vercel's project settings, add an env var `VITE_API_BASE_URL` set to
   the deployed Render URL (no trailing slash), then redeploy the frontend.

**Cold-start trade-off, on purpose:** Render's free tier sleeps a service
after ~15 minutes of inactivity and takes 30-60s to wake on the next request.
`apiClient.ts`'s 1.2s timeout (chosen so an *absent* server never stalls the
UI) means a cold server will usually look "unreachable" on the first request
after a period of no traffic, and the app will fall back to local
computation for that request — exactly as designed, since "server down" and
"server not deployed" are meant to be indistinguishable to the client. A
second request shortly after (once the cold start finishes in the
background) will succeed normally.

### All commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start the dev server on http://localhost:3001 |
| `npm run server` | Start the optional wallet/settlement server on http://localhost:4400 |
| `npm run build` | Production build into `dist/` |
| `npm run preview` | Serve the production build locally to test it |
| `npm run lint` | Type-check the codebase (`tsc --noEmit`) |
| `npm test` | Run the full test suite (Vitest) |
| `npm run test:coverage` | Run the test suite with a coverage report (same checks CI runs) |

## Running it as a live site

Because the app is 100% static after building, hosting is simple:

1. `npm run build` — produces the `dist/` folder.
2. Deploy `dist/` to any static host:
   - **Netlify / Vercel** (easiest): connect the GitHub repo, set build command `npm run build` and output directory `dist`. Every push auto-deploys.
   - **GitHub Pages:** push `dist/` to a `gh-pages` branch (or use an action).
   - **Any web server:** copy `dist/` to the server's web root.

No environment variables, database or server-side code required.

## Changelog (latest)

### July 2026 — Multi-club, Squad & Transfer Overhaul

**Bug Fixes:**
- Multi-club owners now see a club switcher in both ClubManager and TransferMarket
- Transfer bids are now reserved immediately from wallet, and refunded automatically if outbid or on withdrawal
- Bid history is correctly logged in the bankroll history
- Squads now contain 18 players (11 starters + 7 reserves) instead of just 11 — enough bench depth to cover injuries
- Injured / suspended players are now excluded from the starting XI automatically, with the best available healthy bench player filling in
- The starting XI picker in ClubManager now prevents selecting injured players, and visually flags INJ/SUSP bench players
- Multiple bids can be placed simultaneously (one per listing) instead of only one at a time

**UI Improvements:**
- New active bids panel in TransferMarket showing Leading/Outbid status per bid
- TransferMarket now shows a multi-club switcher for players owning more than one team
- Squad tab shows "X fit · Y unavailable" bench count

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Blank page after opening `index.html` directly** — the app must be served over http(s); use `npm run dev` or `npm run preview`, not double-clicking the file.
- **Port 3001 already in use** — stop the other process or run `npm run dev -- --port 3002` (and update the proxy target in `vite.config.ts` if you also change the wallet server's port).
- **Progress gone** — game state lives in your browser's localStorage; clearing site data resets the game (different browsers/profiles have separate saves).
- **`npm install` errors after switching OS** — delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, then `npm install` again.
- **My starting XI has fewer than 11 players** — this means most of your squad is injured. Advance a round to let players recover, or visit the Transfer Market to sign healthy players.
